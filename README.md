# ceRNA-ESCC
Immunotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) exhibits notable variability in efficacy. Concurrently, recent research emphasizes circRNAs' impact on the ESCC tumor microenvironment. Thereforem we construct a comprehensive immune-related circRNA–microRNA–mRNA network to elucidate their roles in ESCC.

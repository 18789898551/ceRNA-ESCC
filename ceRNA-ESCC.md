# ceRNA-ESCC

Immunotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) exhibits notable variability in efficacy. Concurrently, recent research emphasizes circRNAs' impact on the ESCC tumor microenvironment. To further explore the relationship, we leveraged circRNA, microRNA, and mRNA sequence datasets to construct a comprehensive immune-related circRNA–microRNA–mRNA network, revealing competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) roles in ESCC. The network comprises 16 circular RNAs, 13 microRNAs, and 1,560 mRNAs. Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified immune-related modules, notably cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and myeloid-derived suppressor cell modules, correlating significantly with immune and stemness scores. Among them, the CAF module plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix function and effectively discriminates ESCC patients. Four hub collagen family genes within CAF correlated robustly with CAF, macrophage infiltration, and T-cell exclusion. In-house sequencing and RT-qPCR validated their elevated expression. We also identified CAF module-targeting drugs as potential ESCC treatments. In summary, we established an immune-related circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network that not only illuminates ceRNA functionality but also highlights circRNAs' involvement in the CAF through collagen gene targeting. These findings hold promise to predict ESCC immune landscapes and therapy responses, ultimately aiding in more personalized and effective clinical decision-making.
